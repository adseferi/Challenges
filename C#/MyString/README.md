#README

This is a simple C# exercise, where you have to implement a class called `MyString`, which will act more or less like `System.String`, but without using it as a private field. You will find descriptive C# comments at `MyString.cs` about the problem.

##Compilation and running the code
If you are willing to use an IDE you may skip this, since the IDE itself is doing the compilation and the running of the code. Otherwise, if you are going to use command-line compiler (`csc`), you will have to do as written below:

Firstly, you have to change directory (using Terminal, CMD, or any other CLI) to the `src` directory, and then execute the below code (make sure you installed Microsoft .NET Framework SDK and that `csc` is added to path):
to compile
```bash
csc MyString.cs Main.cs
```

This will compile the code for you. Then, you can run it (from the `src` directory) by executing:
```bash
Main.exe
```

##Submitting your code
