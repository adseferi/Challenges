#README

This is a simple PHP-MySQL exercise, where the user search the database for a book (or a book series). The SQL query to populate the database is given in a file called `create-db-mysql.sql`, which you will need to execute in order to prepare the database.

##What you will have to do

Here is a list of all the requirements of this exercise:
- You will have to edit `index.html` in order to create a way of allowing the user to search, and also find a way to deliver the results of the search. You may use any CSS framework you want.
- You will have to implement all the functionality at `search.php` file. You should NOT use the [`mysql`](http://php.net/manual/en/book.mysql.php) extension of PHP, neither any [ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping). You may use the [mysqli](http://php.net/manual/en/book.mysqli.php) extension of PHP, or [PDO](http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php).
- You will have to [normalize](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization) the database in order to minimize redundancy.
