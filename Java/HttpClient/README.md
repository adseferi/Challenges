In this exercise you are supposed to create a simple HTTP client using Java.

##Classes and methods to implement

The most important class to implement is `HttpClient.java`, which is the Java class that will handle the [HTTP requests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods). In this moment it only has two methods, one for the HTTP GET method and another one for the HTTP POST method (you can handle other HTTP methods if you want).

Compiling and running the code is similiar to [this other application](https://github.com/thingslab/Challenges/tree/master/Java/MyString#compilation-and-running-the-code).

##Submitting your code

[Here](https://github.com/thingslab/Challenges#submitting-your-code) you can check how to submit your code when you finish.
